</h2>

<div align="center">
I built <b>AI ServiceFlow</b> as a <b>cloud-native, serverless IT service management system</b> that intelligently converts <b>natural language and voice-based user requests</b> into structured, prioritized IT tickets.  
<br><br>
My goal with this project was to design an <b>enterprise-style ITSM workflow</b> using modern cloud architecture while keeping the implementation <b>clean, scalable, and beginner-friendly</b>. The system automatically understands user intent, detects multiple issues in a single request, assigns the correct category and priority, and routes tickets efficiently — without manual intervention. ⚡  
<br><br>
On the backend, I implemented <b>AWS Lambda (Python)</b> for serverless compute, integrated with <b>API Gateway</b> for request handling, and used <b>DynamoDB</b> for highly available ticket storage. I ensured production-level reliability by handling <b>CORS issues, JSON parsing errors, Decimal serialization, and defensive input validation</b> across all Lambda functions.  
<br><br>
One of the biggest challenges I solved was <b>multi-ticket detection</b>. I enhanced the NLP logic to split complex user inputs like “my printer is not working and my password expired” into multiple categorized tickets using smart sentence splitting, regex patterns, and priority-based classification. Critical hardware and security issues are escalated automatically using a predefined severity hierarchy.  
<br><br>
From a frontend perspective, I built a clean and responsive dashboard using <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b> that displays tickets in <b>reverse chronological order</b>. I implemented <b>dark/light mode persistence</b> using localStorage and added <b>voice-based ticket creation</b> with Web Speech API, including graceful fallbacks for unsupported browsers to ensure a smooth user experience.  
<br><br>
Throughout the development process, I followed a <b>real-world DevOps mindset</b> — structuring the project clearly, documenting issues and fixes, and designing the architecture to be easily extendable. This project reflects my hands-on understanding of <b>serverless design, cloud reliability, AI-driven workflows, and user-focused engineering</b>.
